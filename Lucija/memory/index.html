	Memory game

	<p class="beginning">
	Welcome to my first memory game!
	</p>
	<p>
	To play it you have to click on one of the icons at the time and 
	after it, click another icon that's not the same as first one. If 
	pictures under it match, they will stay opened and you have to find 
	another matching pair of pictures repeating the same process over and 
	over again until you find all matching pictures. In case you consequently
	choose two different images, they will be covered again but will stay
	on the same spot.
	</p>
	<p class="ending">
	Have fun~!
